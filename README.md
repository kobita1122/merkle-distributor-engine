## Protocol Overview

This repository contains the core smart contracts and generation scripts for a secure token launch. It solves the problem of high gas costs when distributing tokens to thousands of users.

### Features
1.  **Merkle Airdrop**: instead of storing thousands of addresses on-chain (expensive), we store a single 32-byte `Merkle Root`. Users provide a cryptographic proof to claim tokens.
2.  **Vesting Vaults**: Time-lock contracts for team members and advisors with a "Cliff" and "Linear Release" schedule.
3.  **Front-End Helpers**: Scripts to generate proofs for the UI.

### Technical Stack
* **Contracts**: Solidity v0.8.20, OpenZeppelin Cryptography.
* **Generation**: `merkletreejs` & `keccak256` for off-chain root generation.
* **Testing**: Hardhat environment.

## Workflow

1.  **Snapshot**: Export the list of eligible holders (`airdrop_list.json`).
2.  **Generate**: Run `generate_root.js` to create the Merkle Tree and Root.
3.  **Deploy**: Deploy `MerkleClaim.sol` with the Root.
4.  **Claim**: Users call the contract with their specific `proof` generated by `claim_proof.js`.
